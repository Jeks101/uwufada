          <p>5 years later, she extended it to Kamwenge District where it was fully Officially registered as a Community Based Organisation (CBO) and later on re-registered as a Non-Government Organisation (NGO).

          <h3 class="text-center">Our Founder</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px">
            Pr. Rwamaraki Ruth, founder of the Uganda Women United Farmers Development Association (UWUFADA), being the first born in her family found it no joke growing up. She was constantly criticized for being a Girl as the Custom is in most Communities, Women or Girls are believed to be entitled to nothing in the Family.

            <p style="font-size: 18px">
              Her finger was Chopped off by Men who wanted to grab her father's land, whats even more disheartening is the fact that their aim was Chopping off her head instead. Bringing justice to these Cruel men was no walk in the Park as she was Constantly Referred to Various offices all in Vain simply because the Criminals were highly "Connected".<br>

              It is upon this background that She decided to take on the role of Standing up for the Rights of the Voiceless, especially the Women and Girls thereby forming the Uganda Women United Farmers Development Association (UWUFADA). Taking on this Role was virtually impossible without adquate funding since their Financial Status was the Reason for all this mistreatment. Eventually, we started teaching them Commercial Farming, Savings and Credit as a way of Empowering them to be able to Sustain themselves without their Abusive husbands. And thats how UWUFADA was born

            <p style="font-size: 18px">
              <q><b>Since 2004, I've met so many Girls, Women and the Youth whose Rights are Violated; Some are raped, Molested, Uneducated and with no one to turn to, all they can do is let it go on. I was blessed with a Second Life so I figured, it was my turn to bless others</b></q> she says
